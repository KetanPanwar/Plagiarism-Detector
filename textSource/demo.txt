Plagiarism is defined in the 1995 Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary as the "use or close imitation of the language
and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work."
Self-plagiarism is the reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical parts of one’s own work without citing the original work.
In addition to the ethical issue, this phenomenon can be illegal if copyright of the previous work has been transferred to
another entity. Usually, self-plagiarism is considered to be a serious ethical problem in cases where a publication needs to
contain an important portion of a new material, such as in academic papers (Wikipedia, 2010). On the other hand, it is
common for researchers to rephrase and republish their research, tailoring it for different academic journals and conference
articles, to disseminate their research to the widest possible interested public. However, these researchers must include in
each publication a meaningful or an important portion of a new material (Wikipedia, 2010). There are various classifications
for levels of plagiarism. For instance, IEEE (2010) categorized plagiarism into five levels, or degrees, of misconduct, ranging
from the most serious (Level One) to the least serious (Level Five): Level One: The uncredited verbatim copying of a full paper,
or the verbatim copying of a major portion (greater than half of the original paper) Level Two: The uncredited verbatim
copying of a large portion (less than half of the original paper). Level Three: The uncredited verbatim copying of individual
elements (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, figures). Level Four: The uncredited improper paraphrasing of pages or paragraphs.
Level Five: The credited verbatim copying of a major portion of a paper without clear delineation (e.g., quotes or indents). Loui
(2002) handled eight allegations of plagiarism related to students' works. Collberg et al. (2005) proposes eight ranks of
plagiarism.
