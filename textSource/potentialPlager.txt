General relativity (GR, also known as the general theory of relativity or GTR) is
the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the
current description of gravitation in modern physics.
General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation,
providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime.
In particular,the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever
matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations,
a system of partial differential equations.
This is reminiscent of Galileo’s argument: the observer lets go of some
objects which remain in a state of uniform motion (with respect to him!).
Albert Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of
physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed
of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels.
As a result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known
as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at 
different times for another.
Why would this be true? The answer can be traced back to the way in
which gravity affects bodies. Remember (see Sect. 4.3.3) that the quantity
we called m (the mass) played two different roles in Newton’s equations.
The whole of the General Theory of Relativity rests on this postulate,
and will fail if one can find a material for which the inertial and gravitational masses
have different values.
