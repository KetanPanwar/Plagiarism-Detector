Two objects exert a force of attraction on one another known as "gravity."
Sir Isaac Newton quantified the gravity between two objects when he formulated
his three laws of motion. The force tugging between two bodies depends on how
massive each one is and how far apart the two lie. Even as the center of the 
Earth is pulling you toward it (keeping you firmly lodged on the ground), your
center of mass is pulling back at the Earth. But the more massive body barely 
feels the tug from you, while with your much smaller mass you find yourself firmly
rooted thanks to that same force. Yet Newton's laws assume that gravity is an innate
force of an object that can act over a distance.

Albert Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of
physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed
of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels.
As a result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known
as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at 
different times for another.

As he worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity, Einstein realized
that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time. Imagine setting a large body in
the center of a trampoline. The body would press down into the fabric, causing it to dimple.
A marble rolled around the edge would spiral inward toward the body, pulled in much the
same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space.
