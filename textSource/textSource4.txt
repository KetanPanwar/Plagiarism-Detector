Consider the following experiment: a person is put in a room-size box high
above the moon (chosen because there is no air and hence no air friction)
with a bunch of measuring devices. This box is then taken high above the
lunar surface and then let go: the box is then freely falling. The question
is now, can the observer determine whether he/she is falling or whether
he/she is in empty space unaffected by external forces (of course the answer
is supposed to come before the box hits the surface). The answer to that is
a definite NO! The observer can do experiments by looking at how objects
move when initially at rest and when given a kick, he/she will find that they
appear to move as is there were no gravitational forces at all! Similarly any
experiment in physics, biology, etc. done solely inside the box will be unable
to determine whether the box is freely falling or in empty space.
Why is that? Because of the equality of the gravitational and inertial
masses. All objects are falling together and are assumed to be rather close
to each other (the box is not immense) hence the paths they will follow will
be essentially the same for each of them. So if the observer lets go of an
apple, the apple and the observer follow essentially the same trajectory, and
this implies that the observer will not see the apple move with respect to
him. In fact, if we accept the priniciple of equivalence, nothing can be done
to determine the fact that the observer is falling towards the Moon, for this
can be done only if we could find some object which behaved differently from
all the rest, and this can happen only if its gravitational and inertial masses
are different. The principle of equivalence then implies that the observer
will believe that he/she is an inertial frame of reference...until disabused of
the notion by the crash with the surface.
